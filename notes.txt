p2p networking

2 types (structured vs unstructured)

	- structured: peers organize into a specific structure that allows
	  each to oversee a specific portion of the network.
	- unstructured: no set structure. any peer can join the network by
	  duplicating the links already established. (much easier to implement).


How File Sharing Works

	- Establish a network connection via TCP
	- Handshake mechanism so peers can identify eachother
	- File Chunking: divide files into chunks for easier transmission.
	Assign a unique identifier to each chunk.
	- Data Transfer: Basic Request-Response system
		- Request: Peer A requwests chunk X from Peer B.
		- Response: Peer B sends chunk X to Peer A.
		- Use a checksum for validation that the file is not
		  uncorrupted.
	- Peer Discovery: Hardcode a list of peers, or have a small
	  centralized server with a list of peers?

	- Overlay? Used as an application layer for indexing and peer
	  discovery              
	
	- File Assembly
